# CS 262 Monopoly Client

This is the client application for the [CS 262 sample Monopoly project](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project).

This application is based on the standard network data service tutorial, 
converted to read (GET only) from the CS 262 Monopoly data service. ReactNative
supports the other CRUD operations (PUT, POST, DELETE), see:

<https://reactnative.dev/docs/network>

The data service is hosted on Azure.
